WHITE LIES,http://whitelies.com/,OTHER STAGE,SUNDAY,14:40 - 15:30,"You have to say that there’s as symphonic grandeur to White Lies. Big songs, big wafts of synth and Harry McVeigh’s booming vocal carrying the proceedings forward with some gusto."
WILD BEASTS,http://wild-beasts.co.uk/,JOHN PEEL STAGE,FRIDAY,18:15 - 19:15,"There’s an aura of edgy grandiosity about some of the Wild Beasts’ songs, the layered synths, the pounding drums, the clinical vocal lines all make for an uplifting and blissful sound that tingles in your chest long after they’ve evaporated."

That said, it’s the purity of Ellie Roswell’s vocal that carries the sound, here on songs that are succinctly fashioned into hummable gems."

YOUNG FATHERS,http://young-fathers.com/,THE PARK,SATURDAY,13:00 - 13:45,"This is a weird collision of styles, a three piece alternative hip hop outfit from Edinburgh who sound like a modern day De La Soul, adding noise rock and a soulful chorus to make a compulsive brew that is pretty hard to pigeonhole."
