# Glastoscrape
A small thing to scrape the Glastonbury schedule into a machine-readable CSV.

You probably just want [the csv file](glastonbury_2022_schedule.csv) of all 3502 performances in 2022, or perhaps just [the 1820 music performances](last_fm/glastonbury_2022_schedule_onlymusic.csv) in 2022.
