# Glastoscrape
A small thing to scrape the Glastonbury schedule into a machine-readable CSV.

You probably just want [the csv file](glastonbury_2022_schedule.csv) of all 3502 performances in 2022, or perhaps just [the 1820 performances on music stages](last_fm/glastonbury_2022_schedule_onlymusic.csv), or [all the acts that can be validated against last.fm](last_fm/glastonbury_2022_schedule_filtered.csv).

There's also [a Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3j7zanQmaBfSuOcQxr4Flg?si=3ddbf43039b04ffc) of the top track for every artist on Spotify. It's only 39 hours long.
