# Glastoscrape
A small thing to scrape the Glastonbury schedule into a machine-readable CSV.

You probably just want [the csv file](glastonbury_2017_schedule.csv) of all 2901 performances in 2017, or perhaps just [the 2149 music performances](last_fm/glastonbury_2017_schedule_onlymusic.csv) in 2017.
