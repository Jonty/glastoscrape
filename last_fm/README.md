# BAD THINGS
This directory contains tools to import the Glastonbury schedule into Last.fm so you can get comprehensive lineup recommendations.

It is a bad thing. You should not use this thing. Look away.

```glastovalidate.py``` takes the ```glastonbury_2015_schedule.csv``` file generated by ```glastoscrape.py``` and filters it by calling an undocumented last.fm API for validating if artists exist. It outputs the result as ```glastonbury_2015_schedule_filtered.csv```.

To import this to an event page (say the [Glastonbury 2015 page](http://www.last.fm/festival/3918593+Glastonbury+Festival+of+Contemporary+Performing+Arts+2015)), head into the edit view (e.g. [this page](http://www.last.fm/festival/3918593+Glastonbury+Festival+of+Contemporary+Performing+Arts+2015/edit)).

Now open the javascript console >:D

Run ```gen_lfm_update_js.py```. This takes the ```glastonbury_2015_schedule_filtered.csv``` file and outputs ```lfm_js_console_paste.js```. Take the contents of this file and paste them into your javascript console, this will correctly populate the list of artists. If you're on a mac, ```cat lfm_js_console_paste.js | pbcopy``` will drop it into your copy/paste buffer.

Now hit submit on the form. The page will almost certainly time out - keep refreshing the page (and thus re-submitting the form) until it stops timing out. This may take QUITE SOME TIME. I suggest a helpful browser plugin.

Now you can get half-decent recommendations on [the lineup page](http://www.last.fm/festival/3918593+Glastonbury+Festival+of+Contemporary+Performing+Arts+2015/lineup#recommended). You're welcome.
